CSVSearch
=========

A basic node tool that searches a CSV file and returns results in an express UI.

There's all kinds of other Express goodness I can upload with it, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. VERY basic. 

I'm currently working on another feature of this that converts the array of strings to an array of objects, and displays them accordingly.
